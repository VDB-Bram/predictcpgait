# PredictiveSimulations

This repository contains code to generate predictive simulations of walking. It consists of one main script:

1. OCP/PredSimOCP.m
    - This script formulates and solves the optimal control problems underlying the predictive simulations.
    
To generate the figures presented in the paper, please run the different scripts in ResultsAnalysis.
