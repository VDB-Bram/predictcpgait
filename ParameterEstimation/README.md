# ParameterEstimation

This repository contains code to estimate personalized muscle-tendon parameters. This code is inspired from [Falisse et al. (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7748556).

The main script is parameterEstimation_main.m. The other files are called from the main. The best way to get started is to run the main script and explore the different steps (make sure you install CasADi beforehand: [see CasADi website](https://web.casadi.org/)).
