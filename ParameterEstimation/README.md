# ParameterEstimation

This repository contains code to estimate personalized muscle-tendon parameters. This code is inspired from [Falisse et al. (2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7748556).

The main script is parameterEstimation_main.m. The other files are called from the main. The best way to get started is to run the main script and explore the different steps (make sure you install CasADi beforehand: [see CasADi website](https://web.casadi.org/)). **WARNING: only a subset of the data is shared on Github to limit the size of the repository. This dataset is sufficient for running the predictive simulations but not for running the parameter estimation and deriving the spasticity models. You can find the full dataset in [this repository](https://simtk.org/projects/predictcpgait).**
