# ForwardSimulation

This repository contains code to generate EMG-driven forward simulations. It consists of two main functions:

1. generateForwardSimulation_IPSA_main.main
    - This script generates EMG-driven forward simulations for passive stretch movements (IPSA measurements).
2. generateForwardSimulation_gait_main.m
    - This script generates EMG-driven forward simulations for walking movements.
